## Introduction
The project titled "Heart Disease" is a statistical analysis of heart disease data. The goal appears to be to explore, clean, and analyze this dataset to identify key patterns related to heart disease.
## Methodology
### Data Cleaning and Exploration
- **Handling Duplications:** Duplicated rows in the dataset were identified and removed using the unique(data) function.
- **Outliers Detection:** Boxplots were created for each numeric variable to identify outliers, and treatment was performed for extreme values using techniques like the median.
### Statistical Tests
The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to examine relationships between quantitative and categorical variables, ensuring significance in the results.
### Modeling:
A logistic regression model was built to predict heart disease using predictors like Sexe, GlycemieJeune, GlycemieJeune ..
### Evaluation: 
Advanced Modeling: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was applied to further model the heart disease outcome based on multiple variables in the dataset
